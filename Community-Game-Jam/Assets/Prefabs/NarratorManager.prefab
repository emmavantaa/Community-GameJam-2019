  - Hello! I assume you are the spaceship repair guy. I Have been expecting you.
  - I'm S.M.A.R.T and I am the ships's central AI.
  - For some reason the power has gone off. Check if someone has unplugged the central
    cord.
  - Great. Someone actually has unplugged it. Plug it back in and you should be ready
    to go.
  - Well whaddaya know. The exit door closed. That's some ridicolous engineering right
    there.
  - You need to access the main decks's computer to unlock the door. I don't think
    the crew left keycard for that door.
  - Maybe there is a green keycard in the workers' quarters so we can enter to the
    storage and look something useful there.
  - Excellent some dum-dum has left the doors fuse panel open.
  - You should try to take the doors power off by trying to turn off all the lights.
    That should do the trick.
  - You did it! Even though you didin't do it as I said...
  - Maybe we can find the green keycard somewhere here.
  - When you find it open the door on the east side of the ship.
  - Well great there is a huge fire. Luckily you have fire resistant space suit so
    we can go right through the flames.
  - Why are you not wearing your fire resistant space suit? Now we need to figure
    out something else. Check if this computer here can help.
  - Type in the password and log in
  - Maybe with this bomb we can blow up the door to the main deck
  - You need to shake the bomb really hard before placing it to set it.
  - Well that didin't go as planned. You need to try something else.
  - Apparently the ship's security robots have also activated. Don't worry though
    they are 100% friendly.
  - Looks like you look too hostile for them. Maybe if you find some disguise you
    could go past them.
  - Do you seriously think a box will fool them? They are the best security robots.
    That will never work.
  - Apparently it did work.. Maybe we need to order some new ones.
  - Ok press the button in the main deck and it should open the exit door.
  - You don't need more bombs right now.
  - You need to hold the bomb before shaking
  - You need to hold the bomb before you can throw it.
  - That should do the trick
  - Move further away from the door
  - You are too far away from the door to thow it into it
  - The exit door is now open. Exit the ship quickly.
  - Why are you searching trashcans?
  - You need to hold the keycard to use it.
